{"000":"From line 150 I took the train from Houyet to Dinant. Then I biked from Dinant to Yvoir were I started tracking line 128. On the picture the first level crossing after the station of Yvoir, which just cannot be seen in the picture. The rail on the left belongs to te line towards Ciney.","001":"After the level crossing the railway is broken up.","010":"On top of the bridge there is a sign for a gas pipe. The path on the bridge is kept in a good state, the bushes and brambles have been trimmed. There are also cloths and garbage scattered around.","011":"This is the station of &Eacute;vrehailles-Bauche. Here the restaurant Le Terminus is established nowadays.","012":"On the piece of track after the station there are some holiday houses build on the railway dyke. If they want to rebuild this partof the line they would have to buy these peoples houses first. From there the railway runs into the forest of the valley. All roads here are private property and therefore forbidden. So I decided to follow the railway itself, there is a small path next to the rails. It was not really warm, but with my bike and luggage it was quite a heavy job involving lots of perspiration. ","013":"The station of Purnode. From Ciney to this station the touristic trains drive again since 2007. The station itself is rented as a holiday house by a survival organisation, which also ownes the van on the picture. The station is quite far from the village, the railway runs much nearer to the village then this place, but I guess this was the best site for a station.","014":"The three tunnels between Dorinne-Durnal and Purnode, at least when I was standing here the three tunnels could be clearly recognised. On the picture it does not really show. When I was here in the nineties the tracks were almost overgrown by brambles. We went to swim in a lake of a stone quarry nearby. ","015":"I cannot rally remember when and where exactly I took this photo. I was getting tired and it was getting late. It was time to put up the tent. So I went up the first road uphill. It was quite a climb untill I found a nice place to shelter.","016":"The same night I went down into the valley to the river to wash myself. By the time I got here it was dark. After I dived into the icekold river I smelled worse then before, but at least I got rid of the sweattiness. The next morning I went back to photograph this bridge. This is the road to Spontin-Sources, where they make the spring water. To the right lies the tunnel of Spontin.","017":"At the tunnel of Spontin there is this sign. It says: Mortal danger, circulating on the tracks or its neighbourhood is forbidden for all non authorised persons. The first time I saw such a sign near a railway tunnel. It made such an impression I did not go in. I still had to bike another 80 kilometers that day.","018":"The tunnel of Spontin, 501 meters long.","019":"This is the station of Spontin, viewed in the direction towards Yvoir. After the station there is the bridge and the tunnel.","002":"Through the bridge of Yvoir the railway runs on a bridge.","020":"The left track is the track to Yvoir. It lies parallell to another railway untill Ciney.","021":"This is the station of Braibant. The right track is used by the touristic trains to Ciney (and Yvoir). I biked from here straight to Ciney. I first had to cross a hill/mountain, it started to hurt after 4 days of biking.","022":"The tracks to Ciney","023":"The station of Ciney. There was a lot of work going on here, so I couldn't really get the station on the picture nicely. From here I went further tracking line 126 towards Huy.","003":"Another part of the bridge through Yvoir.","004":"This is the tunnel from Yvoir. First I biked around the mountain, then I walked into the tunnel. While I was standing here in the darkness, a group of scouts passed me. The front end of te group did not even notice me, untill some girls in the back of the group started screaming in Dutch. One of the leaders of the group asked me if I was part of the group. I answered them in French I did not understand them and walked away.","005":"Just before the tunnel lies the stop Yvoir-Carri&egrave;res, near the stone quarries. The tracks lie to the left in the bushes.","006":"Just a bit further the tracks run over a road.","007":"the bridge from below.","008":"This is one of the bridges crossing the Bocq river. The line follows the river through the valley. Untill the station of &Eacute;vrehailles-Bauche the line is quite easy using normal roads. From this station on the roads climb to the plateaus on the hills. ","009":"A small distance from &Eacute;vrehailles lies this bridge.","00O":"From line 150 I took the train from Houyet to Dinant. Then I biked from Dinant to Yvoir were I started tracking line 128. On the picture the first level crossing after the station of Yvoir, which just cannot be seen in the picture. The rail on the left belongs to te line towards Ciney."}
