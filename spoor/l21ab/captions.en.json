{"000":"The reportage starts at the freight station of Genk, formerly known as Winterslag. This part of the railway line is still in use, it is very busy here. As you can see the railway was prepared for electric traction.","001":"This picture was taken a few hundred meters from the last one. The railway here is still used for shunting long trains. ","010":"This is where the shunting yard ends, or begins, depending on which side it starts. De picture was taken looking towards Winterslag.","011":"This is the station of Waterschei","012":"The station was completely abandoned. For a while it housed a shop or something, but these days it is totally empty. All entries are sealed thight, that breathes a Dutch atmosphere.","013":"The second level crossing of the railway is situated near the station of Waterschei. The railway continues in the direction of As with a single track. This is the last picture of 2006.","014":"Another railway crossing, this picture is from August 2007. The crossing looks like it is in use. But the rails look quite rusty and I did not see a drivable train. Kolenspoor is the railway company.","015":"At the same level crossing as the last picture there's a small platform. ","016":"Close to where the dissapeared railwayline 21A meets this line I found the remains of a signal pole.","017":"This sign is standing in between the old railwayline 21A and the new 21A (formerly 21B). The old 21A is gone.","018":"At the level crossing of the last sign.","019":"The railway now follows the route of the original line 21A. This picture was made just outside the village of As and near a large autoroute N75.","002":"The railway has only one track for a little while. A little further I encountered a second track. The left track is well maintained, the right one isn't maintained at all. ","020":"At the station of As there are some train wagons standing still.","021":"The station of Asch is the virtual end of the line. The rails these days continue to Eisden as railway 21B and used to continue to Maaseik as 21A.","003":"This is the same signal as on the picture before, but closer.","004":"Along the track this little building/case. ","005":"Always wanted to kow what it looks like from the inside...","006":"The platforms of the station of Zwartberg look abandoned.","007":"Between Zwartberg and Waterschei the line has three tracks. The picture was taken from a viaduct over the railway.","008":"On the other side of the viaduct there is this huge shunting yard. On the picture it is easy to see four tracks, but I counted 12 of them under the bushes and trees. The poles on the right in the picture mark the border of the shunting yard.","009":"On the shunting yard I saw these two tracks with poles running along it on both sides.","00O":"The reportage starts at the freight station of Genk, formerly known as Winterslag. This part of the railway line is still in use, it is very busy here. As you can see the railway was prepared for electric traction."}
