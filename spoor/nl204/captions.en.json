{"000":"The story begins at the station of Assen.","001":"The railway began at the railway station of Assen. It ran on the right side, parallell to the rails on the picture to the north.","010":"Here nothing can be found of the old railway, even the dyke is excavated. The path on the picture more or less follows the former railway.","011":"At the table where the two people are eating the railway dyke suddenly starts again. I am back at the old railway.","012":"I took this picture of the pond because of the loud noises the frogs were making.","013":"The former railway is again a sandy path here.","014":"The back side of the station of Rolde is full of railway historic objects. However I do not know whether it is historically sound. For example the sign NS eigen terrein, railways private area.","015":"The front side of the station is more anonymous.","016":"This is the railway between Rolde and Gieten. The stone in the picture is a kilometerpole. The railway here is beautiful, the bushes along the rails had yellow flowers, turning te railway into a yellow line in the landscape.","017":"Sorry about the bad quality. The rails are still here in the level crossing, it is the first time I encounter rails in this line.","018":"A little further I encountered this new bridge crossing the canal. No signs of the former railway bridge here.","019":"The railway near Anderen is now an agricultural track.","002":"This picture was taken near the point where the railway branches from the line to Groningen. The only remains of the former railway is this path.","020":"The road on the picture is the N33, a sort of a highway. In order to cross this road I would have to go a mile to the right of the picture, take the bridge and go back again. I had more things to do and took the forbidden shortcut. ","021":"I lived to see another day. Here the former railway is also a small path.","022":"Hidden in the forest I found a kilometerpole again.","023":"A fence, a lot of barbed wire and a sign forbidden to enter. It seemed impossible to get around it with the bike, so I went around, which took some effort.","024":"On the other side. A camping. The trains are put just left from where the original rails used to run.","025":"After the picture at the camping, the railway crossed some road and then went into the forest. Nowadays there is only a path left.","026":"I am very close to the village of Gieten here. They are working on a road the railway used to cross, so the former railway dissapears at the hills of sand in the back of the picture.","027":"The railway near the N34 at Gieten.","028":"Near Gieten a cycle track has been constructed on the former railway.","029":"Another sand path.","003":"A little further, but still in Assen the path turns into a small footpath. I will encounter more poles like the one on the left of this picture.","030":"The railway used to run through a trench here. There is a little road running over the bridge.","031":"Near Gasselte.","032":"And a parking place.","033":"A level crossing","034":"Here a rare hectometerpole. It is only 1.6 kilometre to the start of the line at Gasselternijveen","035":"A forest track.","036":"A piece of rail in the forest","037":"The end of the track in Gasselternijveen, here the railway connected to the rails to Emmen and Stadskanaal.","004":"A picture of the pole from up close. It is partly yellow and has the initials ZD on them.","005":"Also these poles of the electricity company could be found along the track.","006":"The former railway runs through a young forest.","007":"Here a cycle track has been cnstructed on the former railway.","008":"Untill now I did not see any railway historic objects. Nice that they left the pole here.","009":"The dyke of the former railway ends at this canal, somewhere at the right of this picture. Here a nature reserve begins.","00O":"The story begins at the station of Assen."}
