It was an ideal camping site. A big part of the terrain has been reconquered by nature. There must have been at least five tracks on this small shunting yard. I cannot find any background information about the track.<br> The railway branches from line 24 near the east tunnel entrance. On the place where the track branches there are two seperate tracks. One of them runs to an abandoned shunting yard and runs dead at a new road. The other track runs downward, goes under the new road in the direction of Loën. It's only a short bit of track, but shunting yards are cool.</p>","adventure":"","history":""}
