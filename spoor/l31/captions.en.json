{"000":"The shunting yard near the station of Liers. Once it was a large and important shunting yard were a large part of the coal transports were reorganized according to destination.","001":"The train station of Liers. The track to Ans goes straight ahead, the track to Tongeren bends to the right.","002":"The railway near Liers. De poles of the electric wires are still standing, the wires have been removed.","003":"A level crossing and a small station a little furter along the line. It is called Rocourt Clinique, next to the hospital","004":"A little further the line has got two tracks, or remained to have two tracks. It seems to be in use as small shunting yard these days.","005":"This is a branch of the line, it is the military depot of Rocourt. The tank that came driving straight towards me made a big impression to me, but on the picture it is even difficult to recognise it... It made a lot of noise too.","006":"This is the station of Rocourt. Nowadays it houses a restaurant. The tracks end here, on the remainder of the track the rails have been removed.","007":"The viaduct where the rails went through. These days it is in use for all traffic.","008":"Another branch. This branch lies near the former station of Ans Est. The branch in the road on the right led to a coalmine. The branch in the road on the left is for local industry.","009":"The tracks used to follow the new bicycle track. Nowadays the track stops here, but in te old days it used to run along untill the station of Ans a little further. However they filled the gap in which the railway used to run and totally redesigned everything. There is nothing to find anymore.","00O":"The shunting yard near the station of Liers.
