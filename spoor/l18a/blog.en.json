It runs from line 18 to some military domain. On the full lenghth the rails are still in place, though trees are growing on the railway. It's obvious to me Line 18 remained in service for a long time for military traffic. In the forest there are a lot of signs shouting military domain, do not enter. Finally the track runs dead against a loading platform, probably for loading military vehicles.</p>","adventure":"","history":""}
