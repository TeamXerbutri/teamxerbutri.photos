It runs from Arsbeck to the Britisch military airport at Elmpt. I've got no background information. We visited the line twon times. The first time we camped near the line searching for abandoned buildings in this area (see Abandoned buildings => Brachterwald). I revisited the line in 2006 to make some more photo's. The situation changed dramatically. The former abandoned military terrain is in full use anno 2006, which means large fences, fencing off a part of the railway.</p>","adventure":"","history":""}
