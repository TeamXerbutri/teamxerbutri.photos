I think I did my trip just in time, there were a lot of fences around the yard together with a site hut. I think they are going to remove the rails soon.","001":"The brambles are conquering the rails.","010":"The railway track runs through a nature reserve the Meinweg in the direction of Elmpt.","011":"It's a beautiful scenery, you can have nice walks here.","012":"Furtheron the track leaves the forest and runs through the pastures.

We were able to get through the fences in 2004, but ther's noting left of the old fuel depot, except some smalltrack railways.","008":"Anno 2006. New fences, shooting taking place, and I do not want to get shot. No visit this time, that's for sure.","009":"And back to 2004, a picture taken on the former fuel depot terrain. A little shunting yard.","00O":"At this little shunting yard the military trains were handed over to the British army by the DB.
