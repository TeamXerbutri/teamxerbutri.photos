{"000":"The bike tour story actually starts at the station of Libramont. I arrived there earlier than expected, so I decided to take the train to Jemelle. In Belgian trains your bike needs to be hung in special cabin. I was used to the Dutch situation where you can take your bike with you in a special compartment of the train. So the too fast speaking French train guard told me to unpack my luggage. When I was untieing my last bags, she snarled at me: You take the next train. The filthy bitch. The consequence was that I had to wait an hour for the next train and I arrived at Jemelle (station in the picture) in the dark. And yet I had to find a place to sleep. I thought I found one near a bad road on a meadow. However the road was quite busy, so I did not sleep that well.","001":"I woke up early, actually I did have no choice. It was time to take a look at the emplacement of Jemelle in the light. Here too they were working on the tracks. The line on the left (or in front) was probably part of the former line 150, but nowadays it is used as track to store trains on.","010":"This little shed was standing besides the station of Eprave. I think it is marvellous that they did not break down the ramshackle thing yet.","011":"The station itself is in a better shape. All the stations seem to have the same building lay out, but different styles brickwork.","012":"The cycle track runs trough the bushes and meadows on both sides of the former railway. ","013":"A castle next to the railway.","014":"An old stop sign along the former railway. It is not clear to me why it is standing here, normally this sign would have to stand before a level crossing and not after it. so maybe it was replaced as a touristic relic.","015":"Not far after the last picture the cycle track bends off from the former railway. It ends somewhere on a bad forest track. Again it was not clear where I had to go. I guessed some bridges were missing and I had to drive along the north bank of the rivver to the next bridge and find the railway again. after picking forest tracks in a random fashion I ended up on the right tracks again.","016":"I did find the cycle track again and I found the old railway station of Vign&eacute;e.","017":"Here there are still bridges crossing the Lesse","018":"The station of Wanlin.","019":"The station of Hour-Havenne","002":"These are the railremains of line 150 still used today. The line was double here, the left track ends here nowadays. The single track at the right stops a little further. The cycle track runs along the railway tracks untill the bridge.","020":"The tunnel in the railway section. Exciting!! I think I will not meet any trains in here today. No signs forbidden to enter.","021":"There is light at the end of the tunnel (and inside the tunnel too)","022":"The poles indicate the distance to the next sign or level crossing. I do not know whetehr they are original, since this piece of track has been closed the longest time","023":"A bridge for pedestrians over the railway. ","024":"This is where line 150 connects to line 166 near te station of Houyet. You can see the station in the distance. ","003":"The bridge I was writing about.","004":"The cycle tack runs through a ditch, cut out of the rocks. There is a road passing on the bridge in the picture.","005":"A bridge crossing the river Lesse. The cycle track runs toward Rochefort through a forest, quite beautiful. On this section there were experiments done with a monorail guided bus. They must have been not very succesfull, since I never heard of such a system. ","006":"The white building at the right probably has a rail history, there are more of these buildings to be found along the line. The tunnel is nowadays in use for motorized traffic. The city of Rochefort lies on top of the hill. ","007":"The station of Rochefort. Here I lost the route. There is a deviation, because the line here is private property, but the way back to the bicycle track is not clearly signed. So after some cursing I finally met a Belgian who could tell me the shortest way back to the line. I might have missed a little bit of the line.","008":"Near this roadbridge I found the bicycle track again, and followed it once more.","009":"On certain places along the line it is possible to find these Belgian hectometer poles. On this particular one the hectometer numbering has worn off. The other ones I seen were in a worse state than this one.","00O":"The bike tour story actually starts at the station of Libramont.
