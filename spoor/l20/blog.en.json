In 1900 the GCB was taken over by the state (of Belgium).<br> The construction of the Albert canal in the thirties meant the railway traject had to be shifted and a new bridge was build.<br> In 1951 the passenger traffic on the line came to an end.<br> In 1990 the dutch part of the line was taken out of service and in 1992 the Belgian part followed. The last international freight train using the railway was a train transporting coal from the German coalmine in Merkstein to the cokes factory in Zolder, Belgium.<br> There are several plans to reopen the line. On plan speaks about reopening it for the industry in the area, but other plans are talking about a lightrail system connecting Maastricht to Hasselt.<br> Update 2013: The railway was reopened for freight traffic between 2009-2011. The first freight train drove the tracks again in 2011. The spartacusplan for public transport in the Belgian province of Limburg forsees a railway connection between Hasselt and Maastricht in 2018. We'll see about that.</p>"}
