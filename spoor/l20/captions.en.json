{"000":"The station of Maastricht, sign post T. The line bends to the left.","001":"The picture above is of the abandoned railway, just after it branched off at the shunting yard. The sign pole is one of the few old sign poles left in the Netherlands.","010":"A loading platform. Lots of these walls here are protected, since there are living a rare kind of lizards. It is forbidden to paint them...","011":"The station of Boschpoort. On the green part of the picture in front two tracks used to run, they can still be seen in the road. At the left there is another loading platform.","012":"Then I biked further following the line towards Hasselt in Belgium. On the picture a railbridge crossing a road between Maastricht and Lanaken.","013":"I am standing on a industry branch here. The industry branch used to run from the darker green patch in front following the bushes on the left in between the two wind mills. The railway to Lanaken and further runs at the right of this picture following the line of bushes at the right. The railway runs through a ditch grown full with nettles. Not a nice place to be.","014":"On the picture a nettle and the rails from the railway that connects the industry branch to the railway in the ditch to Lanaken. In am standing on the railway to Lanaken.","015":"This is where the branch used to connect with the main railway. ","016":"This is a bridge crossing the canal Briegden - Neerharen. ","017":"A Bunker with a sign Entrance Forbidden near the bridge of the railway. This was the Belgian first defense line against German (or Dutch) attacks.","018":"The interior of the bunker.","019":"On this part of the line the rails are removed for some unknown reason. They are stacked on the right.","002":"Not far after the sign pole lies the bridge crossing the Meuse river. The sign is red, the bridge is opened.","020":"A few stupid donkeys lit fire to the station of Lanaken. ","022":"The sign in the bushes gives the distance to the next event (sign or level crossing). At railways I tracked before I thought these were old signs that were put there again for rail historic touristic reasons. This sign shows that they had been there all the time probably.","023":"The bridge crossing the Albert canal near Gellik","024":"The bridge is closed off by a fence. I thought at first, I will have no trouble climbing that fence, but after carefull inspection I saw why the fence was there. The bridge is too rusty and the sleepers too rotten to be anywhere near safe.","025":"The railway runs further to Bilzen through a ditch. In the ditch I found this hectometerpole, number 82.3","026":"At this bridge I stopped tracking the railway. It was time to return home.","027":"There is no galery available or there is a problem loading this page.

Once this canal was probably part of the defense system of the city.","007":"The railway runs on top of a dyke when I encountered this bridge. This is also the point where the tracks from the former station of Boschpoort meet the track from the modern station of Maastricht. On this bridge the shunting yard ends.","008":"From the last bridge I followed the line back to the station of Boschpoort and encountered this bridge. The railway crosses the canal, and here it certainly is a part of the defense system of the city of Maastricht.","009":"On the shunting yard of Boschpoort several rail historic objects can be found.","00O":"The station of Maastricht, sign post T.
