{"000":"The starting point of the line is the still existing station of 's Hertogenbosch. Near the station there was this viaduct. However they removed it when I wanted to take a picture of it.","001":"The railway dike is still visible in the landscape. The dike is in use as public footpath these days.","010":"They planned and build a road they call \"parallell-road-structure\" (really!!) on top of where the railway used to be.","011":"Not only the Belgians are known for building useless bridges, the Dutch can too! These bridges were build for a Highway that wasn't build after all. In 2007 there was a parking lot for the amusement park Land van Ooit, but this park closed at the end of that year. The road is where the railway used to be.","012":"This is the bridge near Baardwijk that used to be 881 meters long! Because of war damage it was shortened to 165 meters after the second world war.","013":"The bridge was restored in the nineties and a cycle track was build on it.","014":"After the bridge there is a small length of track. There I found this original hectometer pole.","015":"The track is overgrown with bushes.","016":"The tracks are removed again here and there is a small path.","017":"A path on the railway dike in Waalwijk","018":"I discovered this fence some years ago, it was hidden in the bushes. It is a part of the original fence near the former station of Waalwijk. After decades of discussion the local government finally decided what to do with the poor looking terrain where the railway used to be. They decided to turn everything around, erase the past and turn it into a fancy park. It might look nice in a few years, but even the last remains of the railway history will be gone.","019":"The excavators (at the left) didn't reach the railway-dike yet, but they did remove a large part of the freight station which used to be on the left and was torn down in the sixties or seventies.","002":"The path arrives at the other side of this bridge. It is the Moerputtenbridge, over 500 meters long.","020":"A watch house near a level crossing in Waalwijk. A long time ago you could halt and take the train here.","021":"On the old railway a cycle track was built. This picture was taken in Vrijhoeve-Capelle near the former station. It must have been left behind the level crossing.","022":"A few years ago someone has rebuild a part of the railwayline here, with a St. Andrews cross next to it off course...","023":"This is the platform of the former station of Capelle.","024":"The former station of Capelle.","025":"In the polder the guard houses are still there. This one in between Capelle and Waspik","026":"The guard house near the station of Waspik","027":"In Waspik you can still find the original fences around the former station-area.","028":"The sign at the right says NS private road, so the road on the picture is still owned by the dutch railways.","029":"Guard house near Waspik","003":"This bridge was build to cross lowlands where locals used to harvest peat. They couldn't just build a dike because the land used to flood every winter, the water would have nowhere to go.","030":"Guard house and station of Raamsdonk. This house has been restored nostalgicly.","031":"The same cycle track since Waalwijk, but without it it used to be a boring green dike. It's a shame the replaced all old nice railwaybridges by modern cycle bridges.","032":"In Raamsdonksveer a footpath has been constructed on the old railway dike.","033":"This is the old bridge guard house near the turning bridge crossing the river Donge. These days it is an informationcenter for a new residential area being build on the former station and railwayharbour site.","034":"The turned turning bridge.","035":"Last paintwork done in 1954. Looks quite good for a 50 year old paint job!","036":"The remainder of the bridge and the new residential area.","037":"And the bridge again, turned. When I took the picture it looked kinda funny, but it is rather twisted.","038":"In the eighties there was a new canal constructed here. No signs of the railway here, which isn't weird since it was closed ten years before the construction of the canal began. The railway used to run straight through the middle of the picture.","039":"The old railway runs straight through the middle of this picture too, from down below towards the tree in the middle of the picture. The railway you see in the picture crossing from left to right is the new railway to Oosterhout.","004":"The footpath runs further along the dike. ","040":"This is the old Langstraat railway. The tracks are still here, and used by freight trains. The old tracks used to run straight ahead, but the are removed. The new track to Oosterhout makes a small turn to the left and then it makes a large bend to the right.","041":"On the same spot as last picture, but looking in the other direction. This part of the railway is still in use, so here I stop my reportage.","042":"And the last picture, a level crossing in the middle of the polder.","005":"A bridge again, this is the Venkantse bridge.","006":"On top of the bridge the rails are removed. This is one of the few bridges which hasn't been fully restored (yet?)","007":"Near Vlijmen it is still just a dike in the wetlands.","008":"A modern bridge crossing a road. The bridge was build a few years after the line was officially closed. They probably already planned building it and couldn't stop. Anyway it is useless for the last 30 years.","009":"This picture was taken in Vlijmen, the station is no more. The railway used to run where the footpath on the picture is. The poles on the left belonged to the railway.","00O":"The starting point of the line is the still existing station of 's Hertogenbosch. Near the station there was this viaduct. However they removed it when I wanted to take a picture of it."}
