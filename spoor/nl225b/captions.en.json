{"000":"In Roermond the Iron Rhine crosses the Maasline (Venlo - Maastricht). The Iron Rhine is single track here and the connection to the shunting yard closed off by two crossed sleepers. The former second track runs dead before the crossing on the right in the picture.","001":"The picture above was taken on the same place, but now looking east. The sign means the train can only drive 30 km an hour and there is no train safety system available.","010":"A big gap where a viaduct used to be.","011":"On the other side of the gap the track runs further to the east.","012":"This picture was taken just outside Roermond in western direction. There's a second track at the left of the main track between te bushes.","013":"This piece of the second track was more or less visible.","014":"A little further there's even a third track ending at this loading platform","015":"This is the point where the third track branches off the second track.","016":"A level crossing near the former station of Herkenbosch","017":"The second track is blocked by this obstacle.","018":"Shunting yard of the former station of Herkenbosch","019":"After the shunting yard the line becomes singletrack again.","002":"The useless signal for the shunting yard of Roermond shows a red sign.","020":"The line runs on a dike through pastures and later through a nature reserve named Meinweg.","021":"Again a level crossing. The picture was taken in the direction of Roermond","022":"Viaduct crossing a forest road in the Meinweg. I came from above there, with my racing cycle. I just slid down together with my bike using the trees to slow myself down. Despite the fact there are no bushes, brambles and trees growing on the track biking along it is not easy. In the Meinweg itself aren't normal roads available. Regularly I had to remove branches from my derailleur. That's probably the reason it broke down last month, I should install some ATB-equipment on my bike.","023":"The next level crossing. The picture is taken in the direction of Dalheim. The sign tells us we have to change communication channel.","024":"In Germany the roads get a little better. This is a viaduct crossing the road to the Dalheimer m&uuml;hle. The old mill is being renovated. At least the same sign as two years ago says so.... I don't see progress.","025":"This is a picture of the track near Dalheim. The tracks look very nice for an abandoned railway.","026":"In Dalheim there used to be a big shunting yard. Some remains of it can be found. Most of the tracks are reconquered by nature. The area around the station looks messy.","027":"A picture of the Dalheim signal tower. The tracks on the left are still in use by the trains from and to M&ouml;nchen-Gladbach. This is where the Iron Rhine ends.","003":"Loading platform next to an abandoned ugly factory","004":"The level crossing control boxes and detection systems are still mounted. While the barriers and warning lights are removed.","005":"Level crossing detection system","006":"A viaduct crossing a road at Roermond","007":"Along the rails I found enough stuff to start a secondhand-shop. A few examples: A wardrobe and enough clothes to fill it, different kinds of kitchen tools, car seats, toys etcetera.","008":"Another level crossing control case. Sticked with stickers saying: \"Nein! Zum Eisernen Rhein\" (No to the Iron Rhine), \"IJzeren Nein wil geen trein\" (Iron Nijn doesn't want a train) and \"Kabinetsplannen hier dumpen\" (dump government ideas in here)","009":"There wasn't any weed growing on the track. This is unusual, normally brambles and bushes conquer an abandoned railroad within a couple of years. It seems like the tracks get some basic maintenance.","00O":"In Roermond the Iron Rhine crosses the Maasline (Venlo - Maastricht). The Iron Rhine is single track here and the connection to the shunting yard closed off by two crossed sleepers. The former second track runs dead before the crossing on the right in the picture."}
