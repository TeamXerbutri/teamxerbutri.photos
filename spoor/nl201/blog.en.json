It was expanding the railway network build by the national railway companies. The line from Zwolle to Stadskanaal was a part of the NOLS local network. In 1905 the sections Emmen - Gasselternijveen and Gasselternijveen - Stadskanaal were opened. On the section from Emmen to Gasselternijveen there was so little traffic the company decided to close it in 1938. Only to be used during the second world war for a couple of months. The section between Gasselternijveen and Stadskanaal was closed for passenger traffic in 1939, but opened again from 1940 untill 1947. In 1972 it was closed for all traffic due to the Herwag-plan, which reorganised the national railways freight traffic division. The rails from Emmen to Stadskanaal has been removed. On a few parts of the line a cycle track has been build.</p>"}
