It is not clear to me why it was left here in this position.","014":"Railway dyke near the village of Eerste Dwarsdiep.","015":"Bridge crossing a canal. The bridge was build for a cycle track. It is also possible that the canal was constructed after closing te railway.","016":"Here I found the remains of a railway bridge. The bridge used to cross a canal, however in a point of time the canal was turned into a road.","017":"The brick remains of the bridge.","018":"This is where the railway from Emmen meets the railway from Veendam.
