So I went to Belgium to finish my report on line 18. This was the last bit I had to do. The line starts at Genk and has been in use for freight only. It goes through a nature reserve. On a big part of the former railway is replaced by a cycling path. The small untouched part is cool.</p><div class=\"line\"></div>","adventure":"","history":"<p>The line was build around 1925 as part of the coalmine-railways. From that year on line 18 starts at Winterslag. Winterslag was renamed Genk goederen in the nineties. It's a huge railway-yard serving local and regional industry. Till kilometre 1,8 the track is still in use. From that point untill a branch leading to a military domain the tracks are still present, but out of service. After the branch the railway is replaced by a cycling path. This part of line 18 was in use only for freight.</p>"}
