On the graas at the right the tracks to Valkenswaard used to run.","001":"On the picture above the track to Weert lies right behind the bushes. The former railway has been reconverted to a bicycle path.","010":"And one of the many concrete poles.","011":"Click on the photo for a larger size","012":"A little road lies on the former railwaydyke.","013":"Near Valkenswaard the former railway used to run under the viaduct on the picture. Nowadays it is closed.","014":"On the other side there\u0027s an entrance. It\u0027s used for storage.","015":"The track used to run along the factory halls of Brabantia","016":"According to my old map the shed on the picture adjoined the railway track.","017":"I couldn\u0027t get any nearer to the shed.","002":"A little futher I found this old railway pole.","003":"The first of many hectometrepoles, number 57.8. I missed this one in 2004, so I went back in 2007 to take this photo.","004":"A large part of the railway is turned into cycle-track. It\u0027s nice to bike here, but the photo\u0027s only show a cycle-track and trees.","005":"Hectometre pole 55.4 on the background next to the tree, in front an undefined chunk of railway history.","006":"This is were the cycletrack ends and a footpath runs along the railwaydyke. It gets higher and higher, to suddenly dissapear at the edge of a new planted forest. I couldn\u0027t make a nice photo of it (trees, trees, trees) so I biked back to the point on the photo above.","007":"There I photographed this pole in the forest and biked around the new forest to make the next photo.","008":"This is where a viaduct used to cross the highway. Nowadays there is nothing to see here, only newer trees in between older trees.","009":"Then I biked towards the estate Valkenhorst where I shot this picture where the railway used to cross this road. You might recognize the old railway dyke by the piece of green between the trees on the other side of the road.","00O":"In Geldrop the railway to Valkenswaard branches off from the track to Weert.
