The rails were still there at the biggest part of the line. It is one of the nicest abandoned railways I discovered, especially the shunting yard near Kranenburg. The reportage has been updated with some photo's taken in 2012 and 2013.</p><div class=\"line\"></div>","adventure":"","history":"<p>In 1865 Nijmegen got its first railway. It was connected to the German network, a connection to the Dutch rail network was completed only 14 years later. The Nijmeegse Spoorweg Maatschappij build the line and REG took care of the exploitation. The NMS hoped to shatter the monopoly of the NRS on traffic to Germany. On request of the Deutsche Bahn the line closed in 1991. Railway tickets were very expensive on this line when crossing the border, it had little passenger traffic and no freight. Ever since the line closed people are talking about reopening the line, but serious steps were never taken. The line has an uncertain future and bit by bit it's rails get removed.</p>"}
