{"000":"At this point line 18 used to run straight ahead, while line 15 takes a left bend. Nowadays a cycle-track replaced the railway.","001":"A little further I encountered this viaduct. It's from an old tramway, nowadays there's a cycle-track. The viaduct was not reused, trees are growing on top of it..","010":"Everywhere in Belgium I encountered these weird concrete objects. I have no idea what their purpose was.","011":"In the neighbourhood of Eksel someone placed these old signs along the track.","012":"Here's another sign, but it has no relation with the last one.","013":"And a hectometrepole, but it is not original. The kilometers didn't match the distance on my bicycle computer.","014":"Some organisation rebuild the stop of Eksel, including a bit of rails.","015":"This is the military domain of Eksel.","016":"Between Overpelt and Eksel I encountered this Saint Andew's cross.","017":"In Neerpelt line 18 still has its rails, probably this part has been in use by the station railyard. This buffer was surrounded by bushes.","018":"This picture, taken in the direction of Houthalen, shows line 18 (running straight ahead) branching off line 19.","019":"This is signal-tower II at Neerpelt","002":"At Helchteren a modern viaduct crosses the former railway. I think it's a little strange, since this part of the line closed quite a long time ago. Maybe there were plans for reopening the line.","020":"The signal-tower looks ramshackle, but still people are at work in there. A situation you wouldn't encounter in the Netherlands.","021":"This part of the railway is in use by freight trains, nowadays a part of line 19","022":"This is the bridge crossing the canal, looking in the direction of Eindhoven. One day there were 4 bridges here, every track had its own bridge. The cycle-track crosses the canal via the old line-18 railwaybridge..","023":"This is the bridge crossing the canal, looking in the direction of Neerpelt. The bridge on the left is still used.","024":"There used to be 4 seperate bridges, two belonging to line 18 and two belonging to line 19. The track went up via 4 seperate dykes. For a local road four tunnels were constructed. This is a tunnel under line 18. It's closed up a long time ago.","025":"This is a tunnel under line 19. The rails and even the trackbed on top of the viaduct has been removed. Nature reconquers the remains.","026":"The tunnel under the used track is new, but still very narrow.","027":"At Achel a bridge crossing the Prinsenbeek","028":"The border. The road here is new. A cycle-track replaced the old railway. Looking in the direction of Neerpelt.","029":"A culvert under the railway. The ditch even has a name: De Voortloop","003":"A little further there's this viaduct, looking a bit older.","004":"The former railway goed through a beautiful area with hills and swampy valleys. The railway had a lot of little bridges. On the picture the most ugly bridge. On the other side of the track I found tracks of an old road: a little bridge and a warning-sign for trains. I've no pictures due to bad light and the dark forest.","005":"Click on the photo for a larger size","006":"I don't know it for sure. The building is not placed next to where the old railway ran. But it sure looks like a station.","007":"The signs said: no trespassing. I didn't notice them and took a look inside. I hope they didn't renovate it this way.","008":"I hope it still needs some work...","009":"Between Wijchmaal and Eksel I found this beautiful little bridge.","00O":"At this point line 18 used to run straight ahead, while line 15 takes a left bend. Nowadays a cycle-track replaced the railway."}
