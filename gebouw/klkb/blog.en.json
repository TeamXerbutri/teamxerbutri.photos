According to my planning I would go railtracking, but this building looked too tempting. Later I discovered that my in-laws used to go on holiday at this place.  </p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>In 1877 the Brothers of Fransiscus founded an institute for neglected German youth. It started in a little farm, but in 1891 the monastery was built.   Joseph Goebbels (minister of propaganda in Hitlers government) got his primary education here. From 1914 on Dutch youth was allowed to take part on the education too.   In 1932 the ULO-education started. After 1934 the students are Dutch only. In the Seventies the monks established that education wasn't their task anymore and started  other activities. The first activity was started in 1978, the centre was opened for visitors and groups for religion-holidays. In 1988 the school closed.  In the eighties and nineties the complex was renovated and more and more activities take place. In 2001 the monks stop with the center and it became privately owned.   In 2004 the center Bleijerheide closes it activities in the old monastery and the area is used for new residential buildings. The first houses were ready in 2006. The monastery will be partly demolished, partly turned into apartments. </p>"}
