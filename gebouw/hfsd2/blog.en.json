Normally I rarely revisit sites, but this time other team members wanted to see the location. We discovered the location with Google Earth a long time ago. I think it is one of the best known urbex buildings in Germany. Last time we saw a lot of people walking and climbing the building. This time we met some urban explorers/photograpers. Five of them.  </p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>Somewhere in the fifties Thyssen established this factory. It produced pellets that optimize processes in coke plants. In 1982 the factory was closed and was abandoned. In the meanwhile all machines were removed. The factory suffers from vandalism and its future is uncertain. It may be demolished, but on the other hand it could be turned into a landschafspark. </p>"}
