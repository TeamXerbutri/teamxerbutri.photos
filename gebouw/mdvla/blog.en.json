On the airfield, which is still partly in use, we were questioned by a taxi driver. He asked us what we were doing here. So we told him: Nothing, just wandering and making some pictures, is that not allowed? He told us it wasn't allowed to walk there, so we thanked him and went away. How much bad luck can one have on one day?</p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>The site was opened in 1954 as British airfield. The British stayed here untill 1999, on the first of December they closed the airfield. In 2002 it was sold in order to develop it into a regional airfield. On the first of May 2003 the new airport was opened. The terrain is guarded by a security company, several parts of the terrain are being used by companies and as housing for airport personell. If you get busted on parts of the terrain forbidden to enter, the fine can run up to thousands of euro's. That's not funny.</p>"}
