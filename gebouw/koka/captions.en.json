{"000":"View from a small hill over the partly demolished factory. Once a lot of buildings like the green one on the right were standing on this terrain.","001":"I found a Hoesch helmet here, while it is not a Hoesch factory as far as I know.","010":"This part of the terrain is still in use. On the picture it looks quite far, but the train shunts and drives along the edge of the terrain in clear sight.","012":"The Chinese left their shanty over here when they left. You can find Chinese papers, prints and porcelain.","013":"Safes and a Chinese paper.","014":"In another building","015":"I was on the edge of the terrain on a hill while a teammember was taking some last pictures. When a red car came driving by we were talking over the walkie talkie. I warned him, but it was to late. The security guy went into stalling, so he could deliver him to the police. My friend decided that it wasn't a good idea, so we decided to make a run for it. We made it.","002":"In the cellar of the water purification building. The Chinese left the building and equipment here, they probably don't need that in China.","003":"From left to right, the cokes oven, the black cooling tower, the two chimneys and the fire fighters building.","004":"In the building of the cokes oven.","005":"It is a terrain full of contrasts. Everything worthfull has been taken by the Chinese, but everything below a cents worth is still here. Like the wage administration books, with no desks or cases in the neighbourhood.","007":"The oven.","008":"The tower we climbed next.","009":"A beautiful view from the watch tower."}
