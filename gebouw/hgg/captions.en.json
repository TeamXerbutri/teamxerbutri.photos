{"000":"A small car in a glas factory we visited. The factory seems to be still in use. So this can be called our first infiltration job. After spotting a security cam we decided to leave.","002":"In this building we found several pallets with containers of Cobalt oxide. On the picture a pallet with fresh gloves beside the container. A little beyond this point we did see the security cam, that also saw us. Since there is strict security on the terrain we decided to leave. Better \"luck\" next time, because this factory is a far too cool playground."}
