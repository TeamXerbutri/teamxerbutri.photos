The new border had to be protected with new fortresses. The general Séré de Rivières drawed up a plan. The plan contained two fortified lines, one along the hights of the Meuse between Verdun and Toul, and one line between Epinal and Belfort. This fortress is one of the line between Verdun and Toul. The fortress was built between 1878 and 1880. The fortress saw action in 1914, halting the German advance. In 1916 the travaux 17 were started, excavating deep underground tunnels for better protection against German bombardments. When the war ended the fortress became obsolete due to the Maginot line build along the new border with Germany. <br>In the nineties the fortress became the meeting place of a german motor cycle club. They held big prties and damaged the fortress badly. The fort still belongs to the french army. It is now completely closed off.</p>"}
