Last time we went down here, but back then it was already in a pretty bad shape Now it is even worse. The roof totally collapsed. If you go down here you will find a shaft going 100 meters down. One of our team members went down to explore it, but since lots of people threw rocks in the pit, further routes are blocked.","016":"We also found some ammo","017":"The stairs in the barracks.","018":"Taking the other entrance we went down into the underground tunnel system.","019":"Once there was a corridor here, the poles sticking from the rocks once supported the ceiling. It is dangerous here.","002":"On the picture at the left a part of the road leading to the fortress. The road has been guarded with pillboxes and the part of the fortress at the left of the picture.","020":"The corridors were supported by railway sleepers. The wood is rotten.","021":"A little further I found these stairs, leading down into the mountain. The stairs are in a really good shape. When walking trough a brick corridor we came to the underground storing spaces.","022":"I did make some photos below ground, but it was very moist, and all the pictures looked like this.","023":"And a last picture of a detail of the fortress. It is time to say goodbye.","003":"Inside the front part of the fortress.","005":"The generator for electricity. The machine looked a lot better seven years ago.
