This is a terrain we encountered during a walk. It was closed off quite well, but abandoned for a long time. It is not a large terrain, but there's a lot to see. As you will see on the pictures most of the buildings are in a pretty bad state.</p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>I've got no historical background information on this terrain. The following is based on what I saw on the terrain:<br>The barracks most likely have been in use by the British army. I think it used to be the barracks of the fire department of the adjecent fuel depot. The buildings were probably abandoned in the mid nineties. In the years following the terrain was used to as military training area and later completely abandoned. In 2006 the adjecent terrain got new fences and the military was exercising there.</p>"}
