It is located in the middle of nowhere which is really cool, forests all around it, a nice survival area. So we checked it in march 2009. It was quite nice, but it wasn't as cool as on the websites pictures. The windows on the ground floor are shut, and on many points the first floor is collapsed. It is starting to become a ruin.\n    </p>\n\n    ","adventure":"","history":"\n\n    <p>From the 14th century on a monastery was located here. In the sixties and seventies the Saar government had a sanatorium on this place. In 1981 the sanatorium closed and since then it is for sale.\n </p>\n"}
