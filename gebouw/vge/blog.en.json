It was not very special and rather vandalized. It was a bit odd that the house still had its complete inventory: chairs, tables, clothes etcetera.  </p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>There is not much known about the history of this house. If anyone recognizes the house and knows more about it please let me know. I did find an article in a paper about a fire being lit by local youth in the villa about two weeks after my visit. The site will be developed into a new residential area soon.  </p>"}
