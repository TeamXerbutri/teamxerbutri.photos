{"000":"This is the far side of the mine terrain. It is constructed in a hill, so there are steep walls on all the sides and it is fenced of quite well. It is not even easy to get on the mine site itself.","001":"The shaft tower. The only entrance is situated 5 meters above the ground, it is about 40-50 cm wide. The wall is made out of iron/aluminium plates with no grip.","010":"The only broken glass and building material I found in this place.","011":"One of the few sinks that weren't already demounted.","012":"And of course a picture of a toilet, I cannot do without any.","013":"A teammember found this old mineworkers bag.","015":"The Kaue","019":"Finally we got outside. This mine wagon was one of the things still standing here.","002":"First we climbed down along the flat wall around the mining terrain. Then we got up to the entrance and from there down again. A bit like monkeys.","021":"All the doors were really closed.","022":"The last picture. There was little to see in his mine. It has been emptied and is closed off very well. It was time to go since we walked around long enough. We still had to climb a wall and walked back to the car.","003":"The clock stands still at 13:15","004":"These are the stairs towards the elevator. More than 25 years long the people walked these stairs to and from their work.","005":"The telephone","006":"This poster warns for all the dangers available on the minesite.","009":"There is a very creepy atmosphere down here. Almost nothing has been demolished, everything is empty and it is very silent. Like danger is awaiting you."}
