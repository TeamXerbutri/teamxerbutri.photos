We visited it first in July 2007, but we were stopped by security. In March 2008 it was time for the rebound. It was really difficult to get in and definitely not worth the trouble. There is camera surveillance, and not just signs, but also working cameras. Furthermore the buildings are sealed off tight. So you need to be able to climb to get in. And security visits the site once in a while. It is a beautiful location, but almost everything has been properly demounted and stored. We looked around, went back to the car, had something to eat and then security arrived. It's all about timing.  </p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>The economically viable coal fields of coal mine Bloemendaal were about to be exhausted. There was one field however still recoverable. But it was beneath a nature reserve. A neighbor coal mine had the same problem and after a lot of trouble got a go. This mine followed after a merge between the two mines in 1976.<br>  In 1980 the first shaft was being build and in the early eighties the two shafts were ready. There were connections made to the coal fields of both coal mines.<br>  Everything went well for the mine until 1999. Around that time the German government decided to reduce the subsidies to the coalmines. This meant a lot of mines had to close.<br>  In 2001 the coal mine closed, but the remains were bought by another coal mine, a neighbor, which still produces coal today. Production in holdern then continued until 2006. In that year the shafts were closed and the buildings were converted into a shape that required almost no maintenance. The buildings could be put into use as soon as it is economically viable to mine again. </p>"}
