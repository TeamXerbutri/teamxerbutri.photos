{"000":"Welcome to the former headquarters of the CIA in Li&egrave;ge. No, just kidding. I have no clue of what the purpose of these buildings was. It might have to do with the mines in the neighbourhood, or just some local industry. During my visit I encountered two boys secretly smoking a cigaret. They were frightened to death when they saw me. I don't think I look that scary, but they were probably scared I was going to tell their mum they were smoking or something. They were relieved to find out I speak only a few words French. They made me decide not to stay around too long. Besides I still had to bike back to Maastricht so I had a tight schedule.","001":"The building at the left. Local youth made sure all windows are broken.

It's quite a large room.","003":"In that room only these showers and or toilets where the only thing that reminded of its past.","004":"On the inner court there was a little car junkyard. From the little remains I discovered a Citro&euml;n AZU. A little further in the yard I found this Pontiac Tempest, with a lot more of it remaining. American quality?","005":"The dashboard of the Tempest."}
