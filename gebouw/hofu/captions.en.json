{"000":"Welcome at the cat hotel, we wish you a nice stay in our holiday resort.","001":"The hotel and the stony suuroundings. Once this island used to be covered with grain fields. The old fields are now dry and stony, waiting for the next holiday resort to be built upon. ","010":"Lots of stairs...","011":"Flowers","012":"The hotel needs some maintance....","013":"Near the swimming pool.","014":"The swimming pool, diving is not allowed, and cannot be recommended too these days.","015":"STOP! Pas op kan glad zijn. A dutch warning sign \"Caution wet floors\". It is weird to encounter dutch language signs in a spanish holiday resort.","016":"The abandoned hotel and swimming pool","017":"Tiles, a palmtree and a cat. Kats have taken over the hotel rooms and the place is being reconquered by nature.","018":"At the fence between the public street and the hotel matrasses and beds are stacked. From the street side waste is thrown over the fence, from the hotel-side useable items are thrown over the fence.","019":"The stairs from the street to the entrance of the hotel.","002":"All-inclusive is the new trend, free booze and free food, a holiday without ever having to leave the hotel. This island has no regulations on the amount of hotels to be built. As a consequence lots of room capacity is being build, and lots of abandoned hotels.","020":"Entrance","021":"Stairs","022":"And the last picture, the stairs with nice tiles. We leave now...","003":"The hotel looks nice though.","004":"The paint starts to wear off.","005":"Beautiful details, flowers and tiles. There's even still a bin bag in the bin.","006":"The rooms are all closed, some tiles are broken. ","007":"Beautiful flowers in the hotel garden. The place has probably been abandoned a few years ago.","008":"More broken tiles and nice flowers","009":"The hotel and the sunlight"}
