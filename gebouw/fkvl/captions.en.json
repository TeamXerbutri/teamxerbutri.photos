{"000":"The terrain of the former leather plants here is enormous. Unfortunately large parts of it are closed very well, including this part. But I just really liked the giraffe.","001":"This is defenitely on the KVL terrain, it is one of the smaller buildings and closed off very well too.","010":"Everywhere in this building time stopped at 12:45.","011":"A little tap and a sink.","012":"Where does which pipeline? The sign says the installation will start automatically and that is a good thing. Imagine you would have to figure it out, when you just want to put out the fire.","013":"Another staircase, this one with a pipeline. It's slowly getting dark.","014":"Still life.","015":"The factory had its own water purification plant. With a (rescue?)boat. Why?","016":"And this is the control panel. Lots of buttons for something that seems to be so simple.","017":"\"De klaarmeester\": The water purifier. This booklet lies together with the rest of the archive on the floor.","018":"Before it went totally dark I went inside another building of the factory. It was quite a job getting in here, had to climb through a high window. ","019":"LV 56. In this building too the clocks were stopped at 12:45. This part looks as if it has been abandoned for a longer time.","002":"But still I was able to take a look inside.","020":"A tree is growing inside. Are they more clever than pigeons?","021":"And off course there are toilets","022":"And another one in another part of the building","023":"A kitchen and an office. It was getting pretty dark, so I decided to head back home. Climbed through the same window on my way out again.","003":"This is one of the wings of the largest building of the factory.","004":"At evening there's not much light available. This is and old fire extinguisher.","005":"One of the many staircases in the building","006":"The staircase on the other side of the building, where there is light available.","007":"View on the washing room..","008":"And off course a toilet, for our collection.","009":"A pigeon, the beast scared me. Ms Stupid tried to fly through a closed window. (The vague pigeon-like mark in the left upper pane in the picture) I decided I should go through the building slower, otherwise on of the stupid animals might kill itself while trying to fly through a broken window. Suicide by clumsyness. How can these stupid birds have survived at all in nature?"}
