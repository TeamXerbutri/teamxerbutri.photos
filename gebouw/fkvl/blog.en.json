There is almost constant activity going on on the terrain, except for that month in 2006, so we decided to pay a visit. The terrain is huge, nowadays the terrain is split up and rented to different companies. In the short-term future the building will get another purpose and will be totally renovated. I took the photo's on an evening, so the quality isn't that good.</p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>In 1916 Van Der Aa founded the Lederfabriek (leather factory). In 1920 the international concern of Adler and Oppenheimer took over the business. From 1932 on the company was allowed to use the title Royal in its name. In 1966 the company was bought by Hagenmeyer N.V. During the seventies it got harder and harder for the leather producing companies in the Netherlands to survive due to international competition. In 1970 the stocks from the Koninklijke Chroomlederfabriek were taken over and in 1974 the two companies changed their names to Koninklijke Verenigde Leder (Royal united leather). In the 1990's the situation got even worse, due to international competition, the prices of skins that increased dramatically and the Dutch environmental policy, which meant huge costs for the companies. The KVL couldn't compete anymore and closed its doors in 2000. In 2004 the company was declared bankrupt.</p>"}
