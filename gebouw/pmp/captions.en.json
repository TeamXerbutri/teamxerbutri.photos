{"000":"Overview of the buildings of the mine","001":"The main building of the mine. The buildings have nice colours and architecture.","010":"Welcome to the machine","013":"Impressive! The salt was grinded by the chains on top of the picture, collected and put onto the transport belt.","014":"Another impressive machine. It works the same as the machine discussed before. All the machine have combustion engines, which would be much too dangerous in coal mines, but in salt mines it is acceptable.","015":"These machines held up hundred-some meters of rock under which the salt was extracted.","016":"An underground loc with carriages.","018":"A block of salt. This is the potassium salt extracted.","019":"Since we could not enter anywhere we were quite bored and making jokes about a sputnik being crashed onto the earth whenever we saw weird parts. Well, we dicovered the real sputnik right here...","002":"From the main entrance we went looking for an entrance. But they have built a building within the old mine buildings. Everywhere we saw an entrance and entered the buildings blind concrete-stone walls were drawn up.","003":"The lamp on the building at the right went on when I passed. Also there were security cams installed. Interesting... A short while later a guy with a van drove onto the terrain.","004":"The buildings have a beautiful design. Only the electricity building is renovated properly.","005":"The colours of the buildings are a bit weird. Pastel colours of green and pink. It suits the buildings, but it doesn't suit the rough men at work here.","006":"The guy with the van had already left. Also we did not see any trespassing signs nor did we enter the mine buildings. No worries.","007":"This part of the buildings are in use by a building company.","008":"Finally we got inside, but this path also ends dead quickly. We decided to go and do something more usefull.","009":"In a huge shed all kinds of machines are shown. Those machines were used underground in the mines. This is a chain saw used to saw the salt blocks out of the rock."}
