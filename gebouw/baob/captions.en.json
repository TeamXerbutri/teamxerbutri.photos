{"024":"Boot and grafitti in the loc shed.","026":"And the last picture of the series. On this location a lot of grafitti and a lot of trash is dumped here. It was a nice location anyway.","000":"To get to the bahnwerk, first a number of in-use rails have to be crossed. As a first stage I crossed the railways untill this point between the rails, a little railway house.","001":"I found these next to the railway close to the Bahnwerk","011":"Smashing.","012":"Lots of junk in the building. They even removed a lot of floors out of the tower.","013":"The view from the top isn't breathtaking, but still rather nice. The administration building in the front is in a rather bad shape, but the locomotive sheds behind it seem to be in a better shape.","014":"Inside the building I called the administration building. There are little clues to find of its original use, since the building is collapsing.","016":"In the building I found these cases. The top side is askew, maybe so there won't be any dust collecting on top.","017":"Then I went to the locomotive sheds on the terrain.","019":"This is how the inside of the building looks like.","002":"A nice view of a lot of the buildings on the site. From left to right: the ring shaped locomotive shed, the water tower and an administration building. On the right outside the picture there were more locomotive shed and some other small buildings.","020":"This is where the batteries were kept. Fire, open light and smoking prohibited.","021":"Finally I visited the ring shaped locomotive shed. On the picture a fire extinguisher and the back door.","022":"Entering was easy","003":"At first I went to the small buildings. They were shut tight and there wasn't really much to see in there. On the picture one of the rooms inside the building.","004":"And the last picture of the small buildings..","005":"... after which I walked to the water tower.","006":"I entered through this window. Easy.","008":"View from the watertower on the administration building. That building is in a realy bad state.","009":"While I was climbing up a noise came my way, it became rather loud and the building started shaking. Through the window I could see the train passing nearby."}
