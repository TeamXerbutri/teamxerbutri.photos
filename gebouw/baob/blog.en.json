It looked quite interesting on aerial view. Lots of buildings were closed off.</p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>The Bahnwerk was build from 1934-1939. Here trains were serviced. In 1978 the Bahnwerk lost its status as independent Dienststelle. There is little to find about this Bahnwerk. The problem with finding historical data is that there are three of these workshops in Oberhausen.The rails of the circle shaped locomotive shed are removed a long time ago. But the remainder of the rails is still there and in a good state. Most of the buildings look like they were abandoned a long time ago, but a small number of buildings look like they were used untill recently. </p>"}
