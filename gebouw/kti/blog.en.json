It was to be demolished in 2008. However a few months after the permit was given, local youth set fire to the church. They attempted this several times before, however this time it was a big one. Makes the demolishing easier and the story more sad. In 2011 the church is demolished.\n\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n"}
