It was finished, but due to problems with vibrations in the construction it could never be opened. Still you have a beautiful view over the city of Eindhoven.</p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>The stairway to heaven is in fact a stairway mounted to a waste-hill. This waste hill has been established over the last thirty years with the condition that the lands around it would be developed. There is a golf course and a zoo, the view-point stairway to heaven is a part of this amusement park. There was 16 tons of aluminium used to construct it and it is 55 meters high. It reaches to 70 meters above sea level giving a beautiful view over the city of Eindhoven. The problem is that the wind causes the whole construction to vibrate. Even bridges collapsed due to this phenomenon, so the view point could not be opened untill this problem was solved. The official web page of the Gulbergen says they are working hard in order to solve the problem, but there is not much happening in the mean while. October 2008 the view point was demolished without ever being opened.</p>"}
