There are a few wanderers living in the old factory buildings, although it seems to be a rather well known urbex location. It might be an idea for them to ask entrance fee and earn a little money that way. The terrain will be renovated soon.</p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>The former factory of the company Missil oil was established at the industrial area \"De Petrol\". Since 1900 this area has industrial activity. In the sixties most of the factories moved to a new area in the north of the harbour.Somewhere in the nineties this factory was abandoned. There is little historic info to be found about the site. The industrial area will be abandoned in the years to come. After a huge clean up of the contaminated areas, a new residential area will be built here. </p>"}
