It happened to be the well-known coalmine Hasard. We visited the mine in June 2006. We parked the car under a coal-transport bridge and ate some sandwiches. In the meanwhile we were thinking of how to enter this building. Then a car stops behind our car, some guy walks out of the car and asks us if we want to make some pictures in the mine-buildings. We were stunned. So we quickly answered yes, and we were inside. Easiest entrance ever... But it makes clear the location is very touristic.</p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>The mine closed during the late seventies. Since the sixties it was no longer possible to compete with the low-priced coal from America and England. The geolgical conditions for mining there were much better than in Belgium. Since the seventies the buildings serve as a monument, slowly rotting away. A memory of the once huge mining industry in this area.</p>"}
