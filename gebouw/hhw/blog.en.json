In the mean while I drove by this building thinking it might be interesting. So I decided to take a look. I guess it must have been a building from the company with a name like Heumans. The building is hollow from the inside, and it is dark. Dog shit is lying around everywhere. I didn't like the atmosphere. After 10 minutes I was outside again. Boring and a bit scary, don't bother to pay it a visit.</p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>No historical information available</p>"}
