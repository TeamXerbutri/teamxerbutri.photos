The new border had to be protected with new fortresses. The general Séré de Rivières drawed up a plan. The plan contained two fortified lines, one along the hights of the Meuse between Verdun and Toul, and one line between Epinal and Belfort. This fortress is situated between Epinal and Belfort.<br>\n\tThe fortress was built from 1874 to 1876. In 1890 a underground storage was added. In the first world war the fortress did not take part. This was due to the military plans of France (plan XVII) and the Von Schlieffen-plan of the Germans. The German plan considered a retreat in the former French areas, in order to lure away troops from the north. In the north of France the Germans wanted to advance, through Belgium, to Paris. The French plan was to attack and retake the lost provinces, which they did. The battles took place at the edge of the vosges. After the war the fortress was useless. It is still owned by the French army.\n </p>"}
