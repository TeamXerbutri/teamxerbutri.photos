So we decided to pay a visit in June 2007. It is quite difficult to enter, since it is situated in a residential area which is quite busy and it is surrounded by houses and two high fences. We like challenges. We had to get away because we were seen. The second visit was more successful, however we did not bring cameras this time. <br> The factory had to close after years of protests by residents of the area. I have got a rather strong opinion about that, when you buy a house next to a factory you know what to expect. So keep your mouth shut and don't whine. The storm of protests against the new building plans shows what the skills of these people are.  </p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>In 1908 there was a factory established on this place which produced oils for the food industry. At a certain moment not a long time ago some residents from the area started to complain about the factory. It was smelly and there were going to be the worst kind of possible disasters if it continued. They complained for years until the local government decided to withdraw the permits. So the factory had to close on the first of may 2002. The factory will be demolished, only the monumental buildings from 1908 and some guardhouses will be sustained. On the remainder of the area houses will be build. Of course the people kept on complaining, but this time about the new plans of the local government with the area. </p>"}
