{"000":"Click on the photo for a larger size","001":"Magazijnen (storehouse)","010":"Which we visited next.","011":"The shaft itself is closed off, which is off course a good idea, falling in almost a kilometer deep pit isn't funny. A look towards the top.","012":"Next to the lifts a cabin with a control panel, probably to give messages to the guy operating them in the machine-building.","013":"A sign with the signals in Dutch. It says: Electric signals above ground, extraction personnel, three strokes: up, four strokes: down, if the electric signals are malfunctioning use the manual signals: 1 stroke: stop, 2 strokes: hue, 3 strokes: down, 4 strokes: up. This bothers me, so in case of an emergency (the signals don't work) there are other signals used to go up or down.","015":"Higher in the tower there is this transport belt to transport the coal and bricks outside towards the coal treatment plant, which is torn down.","016":"Radioactive, mortal danger. So I decided not to lick it.","017":"A cabin halfway the tower. Probably for the guy watching the radioactive stuff.","002":"Burelen (Offices)","020":"Under the roof.","022":"Down the shaft.","023":"Staircase leading to the top of the tower","025":"In the old days you could look almost a kilometer down from here.","026":"This is how I like pigeons.","028":"Breathtaking view.","029":"Click on the photo for a larger size","003":"The door to the storehouse was open when I first took al look at this place. It has a lot of floors and is quite high.","030":"Next we visited the machine building","031":"Cooling slots","032":"And we're inside, there are several electric engines in here","033":"The hall of machines...","034":"...from ACEC Charleroi...","035":"... and several \"control cabinets\".","037":"This is the control room for the shaft which is torn down.","038":"Do not press the red button.","039":"Stairs for a lower floor.","004":"In the storehouse all kinds of old stuff was stored, maybe that's why the second time we came around everything was closed off.","040":"Everything in here is huge, like this fan (turbine....) used to blow the dirty air out of the coalmine.","041":"And again stairs to a lower floor","042":"Orde is veiligheid: Order is safety. The sign beneath it says mortal danger and gives several reasons.","043":"Machines","044":"Verboden in te schakelen men werkt aan the lijn. Forbidden to switch on, people are maintaining the machine","045":"The control room for the shaft we visited.","049":"This is a wrapped up part of an electric engine.","050":"The cellar has a lot of pipes. Here we found the bags with copper piping and the cutting tool","051":"A final view of the tower.","006":"All chairs and desks were removed from the offices and since they are standing here.","008":"View on the machine building from the storehouse.","009":"and the shafttower"}
