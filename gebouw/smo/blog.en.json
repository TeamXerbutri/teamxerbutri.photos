In april 2006 we were in the neighborhood and decided to go have a look. A large part of the station is indeed abandoned. But it seems to be a very well known location, since there were like 10 other people walking around in about 4 groups, a lot of them carrying cameras. That made it less fun to walk around there. Most of the old trainwagons belong in a museum, the rest of the place is just filthy and badly vandalized. </p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>The station was build from 1915 to 1918 along the line from Aachen to Tongeren, built by the Germans. In 1919 it was extended in order to cope with the German materials delivered to repair war damages. In the 1930's the station flourished. In 1944 the terrain was destroyed in a bombardment. After the second world war the place was rebuild. In 1957 the station closes for passenger traffic.</p>"}
