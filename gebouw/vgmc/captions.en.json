{"000":"The local monument before and after our visit. ","001":"It was rather difficult to find the actual site. Most of the buildings are burned down or are (re)conquered by nature. The no trespassing signs told us we were right on the spot.","010":"Nice building","011":"Inside the archive of the mine from 1905 to the fifties and other activities until the seventies. From the fifties til the seventies a geological laboratory used the buildings. Always nice to work in the middle of nowhere.","012":"Door","013":"Stairs","014":"On the ground floor the laboratory was situated.","015":"A lot of equipment is still present in the lab.","017":"And lots and lots of paperwork","018":"A composition of laboratory materials.","019":"And a notepad from 1972. Looks very good. Someone must have found it underneath the piles of paperwork in the cabinets...","002":"I really like the architecture of the place. This is a building near the entrance of the site.","020":"... because lots of stuff is covered with dust.","021":"A rack for test tubes, in front of an accu de telegraphie or something and some sachets with a powder. Let's not touch this","022":"More laboratory equipement","023":"In the lab we found the crates again. It looks like everyone fled the place.","024":"A bottle with some unknown fluid","025":"In the next room, bottles everywhere.","027":"In a back chamber conceiled by the dark some shelves with bottles still remain. These shelves were in an okay condition, others were completely rotten.","028":"Drums and a basket from the gold mine. ","029":"Ruins, piles of rubble and now and then a building is still standing.","003":"The site was heavily poisoned with dangerous chemicals and for long (55 years now) the French governement ignored the problem. ","030":"Concrete","031":"More ruins","032":"Brick","034":"And a little tree grows between the rubble. ","004":"However measurements confirmed that the chemicals are leaking into the river and are seriously threatening the wildlife in the area. Therefore from 2010 on the whole site will be cleared and the soil with the chemicals removed. Probably the buildings will not be spared.","005":"Grease.... You will find it on each site.","006":"This part of the site is heavily burned. Nothing but burned stuff and ruble","007":"Rubble","008":"Just like a ruin of an old castle","009":"After walking through rubble and ruins for about 15 minutes I spotted this building. It had lots of no trespassing and security, surveillance signs. So for one moment it thought it was still in use. Until I took a closer look."}
