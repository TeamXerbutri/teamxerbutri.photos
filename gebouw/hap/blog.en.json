Not really adventurous or exciting. It's a rather boring empty hall, but some of the pictures are quite nice.</p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>Someone told me this guy started his own supermarket a long time ago in this little place. When the big supermarkets arrived he decided to sell his store to a big company. This company was then taken over by A&P and the supermarket was renovated and rebadged as A&P Supermarket. However it still couldn't compete, and A&P was taken over by another company. This company decided to shut down all lossmaking supermarkets. So this supermarket was closed somewhere around 2003. The buildings are demolished in 2007</p>"}
