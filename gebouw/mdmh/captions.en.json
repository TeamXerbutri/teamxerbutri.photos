{"000":"Militair Domein, Verboden Toegang. Military domain, No trespassing. I should have thought twice noticing the sign. The fences were some kind of repaired... But you could easily pull the wire netting aside and climb through the hole in the fence. I had misgivings about this place. I thought, well I'll just walk in, shoot a few pictures and walk out again, no big deal. Usually I don't feel that much tension when I'm entering abandoned sites.","001":"Dog kennels on the abandoned military terrain. The last photo on my memory stick. I didn't get in to shoot two photo's! So I hid in the shed for dog food storage and deleted some boring photos. Be quick now!.","010":"A munition storage shed","002":"I decided just to photograph the guard house and leave as quickly as possible. Later I found out it's the only interesting building on the terrain. The remainder of the buildings are small ammunition storage sheds.","003":"The building had six or eight rooms, as I remember. Almost every room had a sink.","004":"and a connection to the chimney.","005":"While I was photographing this tile I heard voices outside. I kept out of sight and just listened. I had made a stupid mistake! My bike was parked next to the hole in the fence. Normally I hide my bike in the forest, but since I was in a hurry I forgot to hide it. Stupid!","006":"Even worse, there were 2 men with 5 dogs. A Rottweiler, a Canadian shepherdsdog and the rest hunting dogs I don't recognize by breed. I was thinking: If I would just photograph the place and \"be surprised\" when they see me, they probably don't mind. I'm just taking pictures, not demolishing anything. So that's what I did.....","007":"The keys... The dogs already tracked me down, the Canadian shepherdsdog just sniffed my pants and got out of the building again. The Rottweiler however, acted like he wanted to taste a piece of me... Lucky me, the bastard was on a leash. The man holding the leash asked me kindly but firmly to leave the terrain, I really didn't mind leaving. So I walked out of the building and with a relaxed pace towards the entrance of the terrain. The two men and the dogs disappeared around a corner.","008":"In the summer of 2006 we were in the neighbourhood and decided to revisit the place. We went there, cooked ourselves a meal. after that we shot some pictures. The guardhouse","009":"A sign telling what to do in case of a fire"}
