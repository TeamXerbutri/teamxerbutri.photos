I did have bad feelings about this place. I didn't know why but was about to find out... Got chased away by the owner and his mad dog. Above all there's not much to see here.<br>I don't know how the Belgian army used to call this place, but I'll call it \"Molenheide\". We revisited the place in the summer of 2006 (we must have some kind of deathwish) The terrain is quite large, but there's really nothing worth visiting it. </p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>The site was used by the Belgian army. It was officially abandoned in 2000, but the papers I found and the Belgian military magazine VOX were all from 1994. The site is for sale.</p>"}
