In June 2007 we took some pictures here. It is quite difficult to enter the factory and that is the only exciting thing, there is not much to see in there. Parts of the factory are still in use for storage purposes. Actually the factory is situated in someones backyard, so it would be my advice not to go here. We did it for the challenge to get in.  </p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>The main building of the factory was build in 1915, this is the building we visited. The N.V. Draadindustrie Neerlandia, a factory that made barbed wire and other products from iron wire, established itself in 1937 in this factory. It is not clear when the place was abandoned by the factory, but in 1973 a rag trader took over the factory buildings. A short time later the factory would have to move from the residential area because of fire hazard. The company decides to switch to trading scrap metal. This is officially still what it does today. The factory is in hands of one family which uses the better parts of it for storage and other purposes. The buildings are neglected and there are ideas to renovate the complete area around the factory and turn the factory itself into a restaurant. </p>"}
