The next urbex would be this canned food factory. Entering the site was easy, but after a short time the security trapped us. We were then picked up by the police. But hey, that is one of the risks in urban exploring. The police was looking for some metal thieves, that's why they secure the place very well. Don't go there, unless you want to get caught by the police off course.  </p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>Source: <a href=\"\"http://www.urbex.nl\"\">www.urbex.nl</a>. In 1949 the factory moved from Haarlem to this location in Cuijk. It had a slaughterhouse for pigs and its products contained fresh meat as well as canned meat. All went well until the seventies when a shipment of meat was refused in America. The factory continued to produce until 1992 when a surceance of payment had to be requested. The factory lost money for a lot of years already, mainly due to the fresh product division, the canned food division still made profits. So Boekos, a competing company, took over Homburg. More then ten years after the restart the factory was closed (in 2003). The brandname remains in the Boekos portfolio. It is not clear what the future plans of the site are. Nowadays it is used as hunting ground by the police to arrest metal thieves. </p>"}
