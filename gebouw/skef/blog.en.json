A few days later we visited it. The windows you could climb through were situated quite high, from 4 till tens of meters above the ground, so climbing skills are required to get in. And you shouldn't look down if you are afraid of heights.</p>","adventure":"","history":"<p>In 1899 the coal mine was established at this place, in 1903 the first coal was mined. The mine was expanded several times. In 1931 the mine was abandoned and taken over by another mine in the neighbourhood. However in 1938 production started again. In 1958 a treaty was made with the mine south of the city and in 1976 the two mines cooperation went even further. The coal fields of both mines are almost exhausted at that time. A new coal field under a nature reserve will be mined in 1977, causing the old fields to be abandoned in 1978. In 1992 the two mines go further as one untill 1999 when all production is stopped. The buildings of the mine are scattered in more than eight locations kilometers apart from each other. The buildings from Ewald V main location as visited by us are partly demolished in 2002, partly conserved because they are monuments. A part of the buildings is occupied by a museum. The other locations of the mine are or demolished, or still in use today. On one location gas is pumped out of the coalfields, on other locations the buildings are being preserved, so they can be taken into use again when the time is right. </p>"}
