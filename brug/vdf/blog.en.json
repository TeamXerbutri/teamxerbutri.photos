We visited the bridge first at the end of the nineties. In september 2009 we did a second photoshoot. The bridge is situated in the middle of France. It was very cool. The tracks are abandoned since the end of 2008, due to the poor technical state of the bridges.","adventure":"","history":"The design of the bridge was made by FÃ©lix Virard in 1901, it was inspired by the bridges build by Eifel. The bridgebuilding took 8 years due to geological difficulties. In 1905 the 92 m high piers were ready. In 1909 the bridge was put into use being the highest iron bridge in the world. In 1976 the world record was lost. In 1984 the bridge was protected by the French state as a monument. At the end of 2007 the bridge was put out of service due to its poor technical state. In 2009 its centennial was celebrated."}
