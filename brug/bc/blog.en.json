It's not really sensational, but we were in the neighbourhood of it a lot of times. The photo's were taken on the same night as our visit to the bridge of Schalkwijk. Normally we entered the bridge from the north, because there are a lot of hiding places. This time we chose another approach, from south. There appeared to be a flat bridge with no hiding places. So we had to sprint to the north end of the bridge. We didn't make it to a WC-record and we think the train to Utrecht might have seen us, so we decided not to stay for a too long time. It'a nice and relatively long bridge, but we've been there too many times.</p>\n\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t<p>The bridge crossing the Lek at Culemborg is a part of the railway line from Utrecht to 's Hertogenbosch. The track is opened in 1868. In that time there was only one track in the middle of the bridge, while the bridge itself was build for two tracks. A few years later the track was shifted to the side and a second track was build over the bridge. In 1983 the presentday bridge was placed. The bridge spans 154 meters.</p>\n\t\t\n"}
