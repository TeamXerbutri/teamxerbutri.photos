This picture is taken in the direction of the Meuse-bridge, which has no hiding places. So we haven't been on that bridge (jet)","002":"View from the trainbridge, the bridge on the picture is where we spent the night.... I didn't sleep because of all the cars making terrible noise on the bridge.","003":"The next morning we decided to get out of our beds. This is the view from our hidingplace. It's time to look for a place to sleep","004":"Click on the photo for a larger size","005":"Lixhe 2006. We made camp in the neighbourhood, so we decided to visit the bridge.","006":"In fact the color of the bridge is not gray, but some other color (orange?). The factory below emits a lot of dust, which is sticking to the bridge.","007":"While photographing the bridge a train was slowly approaching, we didn't notice it untill it noticed us, stil hundreds of meters away. That means trouble! So we got off the bridge. Maybe we'll meet again."}
