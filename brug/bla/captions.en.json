{"000":"View on the Vierendeel-bridge from the east","001":"And the view from the west.","002":"To get to the bridge I had two options: Or climb up from the road along the canal, or walk through this flowery pasture.","003":"The bridge from up close. It is fenced of with an iron fence. And for good reasons too! The iron is rusted and the sleepers are rotten. No way I will cross this bridge, I'd rather die at a more exciting place.","004":"The roller support. A nice detail.","005":"And a final picture of the bridge, the piers were constructed for double tracks. Maybe I will return to this place when the track is opened again (in 2012?)."}
