{"000":"The bridge from a distance. It lies in a silent valley.","001":"Finally we reached the tracks. There are no houses and roads near the bridge. Just meadows. Behind us lies the bridge and in front of us there is a big ditch and a tunnel. Nice.","002":"The bridge! Not as high or as long as the Viaduc des Fades, but still quite impressive.","003":"Take a look down, there are only trees.","004":"The valley and the river.","005":"The sleepers were replaced in 2002, which is only seven years ago! The track has been closed shortly due to the poor technical state of the bridges. Couldn't they have forseen that in 2002?","006":"There is a pathway under the bridge. Left and right and below there are beautiful (or scary) views.","007":"The construction of the bridge, craftmanship from 1884.","008":"The stairs down to the path.","009":"The other mountain side, the last picture of the abandoned Tardes Viaduct."}
