The bridge has the longest span of the Netherlands, it spans 237 meters. It's a beautiful new bridge, but already there's a lot of graffiti. The trains aren't moving fast since they have to stop in the station of Utrecht. There are no hiding places on the bridge. Definitely not a place to be.</p>\n\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t<p>The bridge was build in 2003 next to the DEMKA-spoorbrug. The DEMKA-brug needs a renovation, it's situated in the middle of Utrecht and is noisy. The new Werkspoorbrug is more quiet.</p>\n\t\t\n"}
