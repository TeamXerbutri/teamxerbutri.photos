{"000":"The adventure began the evening before I took this picture. We arrived late in a village nearby the tunnel. We took our gear out of the car and walked towards our intended camp site. Since it seemed to be in the middle of a hunting area, we decided to move out of this area. So we put up the site a little further, and in the middle of the field of fire, so it seemed in the morning as I walked past some hunter cabbins. We reconned the tunnel the same night and while we were in the tunnel a group of German youth was hanging around on the bridge near the tunnel exit. We did not want to be seen, we still had to camp there, so we explored the tunnel for some longer and went back when they were gone. After a bad night sleep due to the cold I took this picture of the northern entrance.","001":"The rail tracks run through a deep and long excavation before they enter the tunnel. There is no way to hide here, certainly not for our team of three men. So we just ran for the tunnel entrance.","010":"We took the easiest way out, up via the scaffolding.","011":"When out of the tunnel we decided not to go back via the tunnel. One of the train drivers might have seen us. The alternative is back over the mountain, the backdraft is that there are no roads from this side of the mountain towards the top. So we walked straight through the forest using a compass. The forest was nice, but it was pretty cold.","012":"Another picture of the forest. On top of the mountain we took the first road down. Following a sign which stated that the tunnels entrance was a 2,5 km walk away, probably that is just a coincidence?","002":"The Rudersdorfer tunnel (meaning tunnel of Rudersdorf), its length is 2652 meter. Our tunnel-exploring system is needed exploring this long tunnels. Walkie-talkies make communication easy. One guy pays attention to the tunnel entrance (where we enter), another to the tunnel exit (where we exit). To warn eachother for the train we use the alarm signal of the walkie-talkie followed by a message, in (for entrance) or out (for exit).","003":"The north portal, with in the background the bridge of the little road over the tracks.","004":"And a train, only my cam didn't really cooperate.","005":"One of the guys discovered this air shaft.","006":"Bitlord made this picture of a train.","007":"Fire extinguisher in a safe-place in the tunnel. Most of the hiding places in the tunnel were quite deep, but some of them were repaired or treated with concrete making them just deep enough to hide.This picture was taken in the middle of the tunnel. The view here was extremely bad. The tracks is sloped down to both sides, making it impossible to see the entrance when you leave this point.","008":"The place of this picture is only a few hundred meters from the exit of the tunnel. One of our guys already left the tunnel at the exit, another is still near the middle of the tunnel. At a certain moment I saw lights vaguely shining the tunnel walls at the entrance, so I grabbed the walkie-talkie and warned my teammate. He confirms a few seconds later. While the train rushes by and I take this picture I get another warning, train coming from the entrance. Another train, this soon? My teammate told me it was a freighttrain driving slowly on the left (wrong side) track. Trouble, because I was in a shallow safe-place and the train will pass by rather close. The roaring of the train gets louder and louder. Slowly it passes by. Probably he didn't see me. The freight train stops a few hundred meters from the tunnel. Time to go!","009":"The exit of the tunnel. They are renovating the portal."}
