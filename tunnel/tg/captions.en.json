{"000":"This is where the exploration begins. The east portal of the tunnel.","001":"Swallowed by the darkness. Light at the tunnel entrance.","002":"This is how a railway tunnel looks from the inside. It's mainly dark.","003":"\"The faces where made unrecognizable....\"","004":"Back in the light, de west entrance of the tunnel in the marl-quarry opening","005":"They dug away a vast part of the mountain, the tunnel is almost pointless: The east entrance in the quarry","006":"In the second part we found this fox, dead. The second part of he tunnel bends to the left. It's really difficult to tell whether there's a train coming. In 2002 we did go through this part of the tunnel, but it took hours to get back to the other side of the hill. There are a lot of quarries in the neighbourhood and you have to walk around them. We went back to our campsite through the tunnel.","007":"And a photo from the 2006 revisit. Proof there are driving trains here","008":"There is no galery available or there is a problem loading this page. Contact the webmaster."}
