{"000":"The sun sets when we entered the Remersdaeler tunnel.","001":"I always wonder what these things are used for. You can find them often in front of tunnels in Belgium.","002":"The entrance. We had to run to get there, it was quite far, without hiding places. Trains drive through the tunnel every so minutes and they do not have a clear schedule. This picture is all I have.","003":"Safely inside the tunnel","004":"This tunnel gives a nice view of what the inside of a tunnel looks like.","005":"West entrance of the tunnel.","006":"The east entrance of the tunnel is at the huge shunting yard of Montzen. Here the trains are driving slowly, so you can be spotted easier. The situation there is rather dangerous, since the trains can some from all tracks of the shunting yard.","007":"The final picture of the tunnel."}
