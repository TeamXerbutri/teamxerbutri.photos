{"000":"The south portal of the tunnel. We've been here six years ago and not much have changed. It is not very exciting here, since there are only two trains driving throug the tunnel per hour.","001":"The tunnel of Givet from the inside. We are now walking below the Fortress of Charlemont. The commandos of the French army are using it these days.","002":"I tried to use the flash here, but the result is poor. You can see the tunnel is constructed in a bend.","003":"Another entrance to the tunnel. The story goes there is a connection between the fortress and the tunnel. The tunnel can be defended and the north portal has shooting holes. However I did not find such a connection, but I did not carry a torch.","004":"At the north entrance of the tunnel these shooting holes. Next time I really have to bring along my torch."}
