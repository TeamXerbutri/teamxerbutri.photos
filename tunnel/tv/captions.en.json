{"000":"The mission began with hiding the bikes, on top of the hill in a forest. The concrete on the hill is probably part of the tunnel works.","001":"Trough the gutter we sneaked to the tunnel entrance","010":"A certain person standing in the light.","011":"This is the east entrance of the tunnel. Time to head back.","012":"We walked back to the west entrance of the tunnel. A silhouet","013":"The end.","002":"The west entrance... Go go go!!!","003":"Green.....","004":"This is what it looks like inside the tunnel. This tunnel is very wet. Continously water is falling from the ceiling and making a lot of noise so you can't hear the trains. Under the tiles on the right streams a little brook.","005":"A lightswitch.","006":"And a lamp.","007":"This SOS-box is situated in a interconnecting gallery. While we were standing there a train passed by. There's a huge movement of air through such galleries. Besides that we saw flashes and heard a crackling sound. Water and electricity, no good friends.","008":"At the east side of the tunnel there's this big air shaft.","009":"Once there used to be stairs up the shaft. Not much left of it nowadays"}
